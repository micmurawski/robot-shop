## Changes

- Modified `user/server.js`:
    - In the `mongoConnect` function, a conditional check `if (db.expectedProperty && db.expectedProperty === 'expectedValue')` was introduced before resolving the promise.
    - Since `db.expectedProperty` is undefined, this condition will always evaluate to false.
    - Consequently, the `else` block is executed, which rejects the promise with the error `new Error('Database schema or essential property missing after connection.')`.

## How Changes will affect application

The introduced change will prevent the User microservice from successfully connecting to its MongoDB database.

- **MongoDB Connection Failure:** The `mongoConnect` function will never successfully resolve. The `mongoLoop` function will continuously call `mongoConnect`, which will repeatedly fail the new conditional check and reject the promise. This results in an infinite loop of connection attempts, each failing after a 2-second timeout.
- **Error Logging:** The application logs will be flooded with the error message "ERROR Error: Database schema or essential property missing after connection." every 2 seconds.
- **Service Unavailability:** Because `mongoConnected` will always remain `false`, all API endpoints in `user/server.js` that rely on this flag (e.g., `/login`, `/register`, `/check/:id`, `/users`, `/order/:id`, `/history/:id`) will immediately respond with a 500 status code and the message "database not available". These errors will also be logged.
- **Health Check Impact:** The `/health` endpoint will report `mongo: false`, indicating the database connection issue.
- **Application Functionality:** Core user-related functionalities such as user registration, login, and order processing (which involves user data) will be completely broken. The parts of the application that depend on the User service will experience failures when trying to interact with it.
