## Changes

- **File Modified**: `user/server.js`

1.  **Introduced a Global Array for Diagnostics**:
    -   A new global array named `activeSessionDiagnostics` was added at the beginning of the file:
        ```javascript
        // Global array to store diagnostic information for active sessions, will cause a memory leak.
        const activeSessionDiagnostics = [];
        ```

2.  **Modified `/uniqueid` Endpoint to Populate the Global Array**:
    -   The GET endpoint `/api/user/uniqueid` (internally `/uniqueid`) was altered. On each successful generation of a unique ID, an object containing the `uuid`, current `timestamp`, and the incoming request `headers` is pushed into the `activeSessionDiagnostics` array.
        ```javascript
        // ... inside /uniqueid endpoint callback
        if(!err) {
            const generatedUuid = 'anonymous-' + r;
            
            // INTRODUCED MEMORY LEAK:
            // Storing request-specific data in a global array that never gets cleared.
            // This might look like a naive attempt at collecting some diagnostic data.
            activeSessionDiagnostics.push({ 
                uuid: generatedUuid, 
                timestamp: Date.now(),
                headers: req.headers // Storing headers can make memory grow faster
            });

            res.json({
                uuid: generatedUuid
            });
        } else {
          // ... error handling ...
        }
        ```
    - The error handling within this endpoint was also slightly enhanced to provide a JSON response and more detailed logging in case of Redis errors.

## How Changes Affect Application

This change introduces a **memory leak** into the **user microservice**.

-   **Mechanism**: Each time the `/api/user/uniqueid` endpoint is called (which occurs frequently, for instance, whenever a new user session starts or the `load-gen/robot-shop.py` script simulates new user activity), a new object containing session-specific information (including request headers, which can be of variable and potentially significant size) is added to the global `activeSessionDiagnostics` array.
-   **Impact on User Service**:
    -   **Increased Memory Consumption**: The `activeSessionDiagnostics` array is never cleared or truncated. As a result, the memory footprint of the `user` service's Node.js process will continuously grow over time with sustained traffic.
    -   **Performance Degradation**: As memory usage increases, the Node.js garbage collector will have to work harder and more frequently, potentially leading to longer GC pauses. This can degrade the overall performance and responsiveness of the `user` service, increasing latency for all its endpoints.
    -   **Service Unavailability (Crash)**: Eventually, the Node.js process will exhaust the available memory, leading to an `OutOfMemory` error. This will cause the `user` service to crash. If running under an orchestrator like Kubernetes, the service might be restarted, but it will crash again once the memory leak consumes available resources.
-   **Impact on Overall Application**:
    -   Since the `user` service handles user authentication, session management (via `uniqueid`), and user registration, its failure will significantly impact the Robot Shop application. Users might be unable to log in, register, or even browse anonymously if new sessions cannot be established due to the failing `user` service.
    -   Other services that depend on user identification or session data might also experience errors or be unable to function correctly.

This change is designed for an incident response training exercise to simulate a realistic resource exhaustion scenario. The symptoms (increasing memory, performance degradation, eventual crashes) are intended to be observable and diagnosable by on-call engineers.
