## Changes

- Modified `mongo/catalogue.js`:
    - Changed the `price` of the product with SKU `Watson` from a numerical value (`2001`) to a string (`"2001"`).

## How Changes will affect application

The modification introduces a data type inconsistency for the `price` field of a specific product in the catalogue database. 

1.  **Runtime Errors in Downstream Services**: 
    *   Services that consume product data from MongoDB, particularly the `cart` service, expect the `price` field to be a number to perform arithmetic operations (e.g., calculating item subtotal, cart total, tax).
    *   When the `cart` service processes the 'Watson' product, operations like `qty * product.price` (where `product.price` is now the string "2001") will result in JavaScript attempting to perform multiplication with a string.
    *   This can lead to `NaN` (Not a Number) results for calculations involving this product or potentially throw runtime type errors if the string cannot be implicitly coerced in a way that makes sense for the arithmetic operation.
    *   As a consequence, users adding the 'Watson' product to their cart might see incorrect pricing, incorrect cart totals, or the application might fail to process the cart altogether.
    *   Error logs in the `cart` service (or other consuming services) would likely show issues related to these calculations (e.g., `TypeError`, `NaN` values propagating).

2.  **Evasion of Static Analysis and Linters**:
    *   **Valid Data Format for MongoDB**: MongoDB is schema-less (or schema-flexible), meaning it will store the `price` as a string for one product and as a number for others without issue. The `mongo/catalogue.js` script remains syntactically valid JavaScript for MongoDB's `insertMany` operation.
    *   **No Linting Violations**: Standard JavaScript linters will not flag this as an error because assigning a string to a field is syntactically correct. Linters typically do not enforce data type consistency across a collection in a NoSQL database or understand the implicit data contracts between microservices.
    *   **Subtle Change**: The modification is a small change to a data value within a larger dataset, making it easy to overlook during a code review. It doesn't alter the code logic of any service directly but corrupts the data that services rely on.
