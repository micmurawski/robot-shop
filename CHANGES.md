## Changes

-   **`cart/server.js`**: Modified the `mergeList` function. The loop condition `idx < len` was changed to `idx <= len` in the `for` loop iterating through the cart items.

## How Changes will affect application

The change introduced in `cart/server.js` will cause a runtime error when a user attempts to add a product to their cart that is not already present.

Specifically, in the `mergeList` function, the loop that checks if an item already exists in the cart will now iterate one step beyond the valid array indices when the item is *not* found. This will result in attempting to access a property (`sku`) of `undefined`, triggering a `TypeError`.

This error will manifest as a failed API call to the cart service (`/add/:id/:sku/:qty`), preventing users from adding new items to their shopping cart. The application's frontend might display an error message or simply fail to update the cart visually, depending on its error handling. This issue will not be caught during compilation or static analysis and will only occur during the runtime execution path of adding a new item to the cart.
