# Documentation of Introduced Error

## Introduced Changes

A subtle modification has been introduced in the `cart/server.js` file. The change is located within the `calcTax` function.

Original code:
```
javascript
function calcTax(total) {
    // tax @ 20%
    return (total - (total / 1.2));
}
```

Modified code:
```
javascript
function calcTax(total) {
    // tax @ 20%
    return (total - (total / 1.21)); // Modified divisor from 1.2 to 1.21
}
```
The divisor used in the tax calculation formula has been changed from `1.2` to `1.21`.

## How Changes Will Affect Application

This change introduces a **logical error** in the tax calculation within the Cart service.

1.  **Runtime Error/Incorrect Behavior**: The `calcTax` function is responsible for calculating the tax amount based on the total price of items in the cart. By changing the divisor from `1.2` (which corresponds to a 20% tax rate, as `total / 1.2` gives the pre-tax amount) to `1.21`, the function will now calculate an incorrect tax amount (effectively calculating tax based on approximately 21% instead of 20%). This will lead to the `cart.tax` and `cart.total` values being incorrect.
2.  **Impact on Application Flow**: The Cart service passes the calculated cart object, including the incorrect total and tax, to the Payment service during the checkout process. The Payment service relies on this data to process the transaction. The discrepancy in the expected vs. actual total/tax could cause the Payment service to reject the transaction, process an incorrect amount, or trigger downstream errors in order fulfillment or accounting systems. This error will only occur when a user proceeds to the payment step after adding items to the cart.
3.  **Evasion of Static Analysis**: This modification is a change to a numerical constant within a mathematical formula. Static analysis tools and linters typically check for syntax errors, code style violations, potential bugs like unhandled exceptions or resource leaks, and adherence to coding standards. They do not generally understand the business logic or the intended mathematical formula (tax calculation at 20%). Therefore, changing `1.2` to `1.21` will not be flagged as an error or warning by these tools, as it is syntactically correct and follows standard coding practices.
4.  **Difficulty in Code Review**: The change is a single digit modification in a constant, making it very difficult to spot during a manual code review, especially in a larger diff or without specific domain knowledge of the intended tax rate calculation.
5.  **Runtime Manifestation**: The error will only manifest during program execution when the `calcTax` function is called as part of the cart update or shipping confirmation process, and the resulting incorrect cart data is used by the Payment service.

This change is a subtle logical error that will cause runtime issues related to incorrect data processing, specifically affecting the financial aspects of the order, and is designed to be difficult to detect through standard code review and static analysis processes.
