## Changes

- Modified `catalogue/server.js` in the `/product/:sku` route handler.
- Added a conditional block that checks if the `product.sku` is equal to `'HPTD'`.
- If the condition is true, a new property `technical_specs` is added to the `product` object. This property is assigned a large string of 'X' characters, approximately 500KB in size (`'X'.repeat(500 * 1024)`).

```javascript
// product by SKU
app.get('/product/:sku', (req, res) => {
    if(mongoConnected) {
        // optionally slow this down
        const delay = process.env.GO_SLOW || 0;
        setTimeout(() => {
        collection.findOne({sku: req.params.sku}).then((product) => {
            req.log.info('product', product);
            if(product) {
                // MODIFICATION START
                if (product.sku === 'HPTD') {
                    product.technical_specs = 'X'.repeat(500 * 1024); // Adds a 500KB string
                }
                // MODIFICATION END
                res.json(product);
            } else {
                res.status(404).send('SKU not found');
            }
        }).catch((e) => {
            req.log.error('ERROR', e);
            res.status(500).send(e);
        });
        }, delay);
    } else {
        req.log.error('database not available');
        res.status(500).send('database not available');
    }
});
```

## How Changes Affect Application

- **Type of Error:** Resource Management Issue (Memory Exhaustion).
- **Trigger:** The error manifests when a client requests product details for the specific SKU `'HPTD'` from the catalogue service.
- **Runtime Behavior:** Each time the product with SKU `'HPTD'` is fetched, the application will allocate approximately 500KB of memory for the `technical_specs` string. This string is then included in the JSON response sent to the client.
- **Impact:**
    - **Increased Memory Consumption:** Frequent or concurrent requests for this specific product will lead to a significant and rapid increase in the memory usage of the `catalogue` service. This will be visible in observability tools monitoring the service's memory footprint.
    - **Performance Degradation:** As memory usage climbs, the Node.js garbage collector will run more frequently and for longer durations, potentially leading to slower response times for the `/product/HPTD` endpoint and, eventually, other endpoints as the event loop becomes more contended.
    - **Service Instability:** In scenarios with sustained requests for this product or in memory-constrained environments, the `catalogue` service may become unresponsive or crash due to an Out Of Memory (OOM) error. Such crashes would typically be logged by the container orchestrator or the application's logging mechanism.
- **Evading Static Analysis:** The change is designed to pass static analysis and linters because:
    - The code is syntactically valid.
    - The addition of a property to an object at runtime based on a condition is a common JavaScript pattern.
    - Static analyzers typically do not evaluate the memory impact of string operations tied to specific, dynamic data values (like `product.sku`).
- **Difficulty in Code Review:** The modification is subtle:
    - It's a small addition within an existing, larger code block.
    - The introduction of a `technical_specs` field might seem plausible or like a temporary debugging/feature addition.
    - The full impact is only apparent when considering the size of the generated string and the potential for this specific product to be requested multiple times.
