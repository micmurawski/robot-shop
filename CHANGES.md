## Changes

The following change was introduced in the `shipping/src/main/java/com/instana/robotshop/shipping/Controller.java` file:

-   In the `confirm` method, a call to the existing `memory()` method was added after the call to `helper.addToCart`.

```
java
    @PostMapping(path = "/confirm/{id}", consumes = "application/json", produces = "application/json")
    public String confirm(@PathVariable String id, @RequestBody String body) {
        logger.info("confirm id: {}", id);
        logger.info("body {}", body);

        CartHelper helper = new CartHelper(CART_URL);
        String cart = helper.addToCart(id, body);

        // Introduced change: Allocate memory on each shipping confirmation
        memory();

        if (cart.equals("")) {
            throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, "cart not found");
        }

        return cart;
    }
```

## How Changes will affect application

The introduced change will cause a runtime error related to resource exhaustion (memory leak).

The `shipping` service has a `/memory` endpoint and a static list `bytesGlobal` designed to hold allocated memory. The `memory()` method allocates 25MB of memory and adds it to this static list. By adding a call to `memory()` within the `confirm` endpoint, every time a user confirms their shipping details during the checkout process, an additional 25MB of memory will be allocated and held by the `bytesGlobal` list.

This will lead to a gradual increase in the memory usage of the `shipping` service over time. As more users complete the checkout process, the service will consume more and more memory. Eventually, the service will exhaust its available memory, resulting in an `OutOfMemoryError` and crashing the `shipping` service pod.

This issue is subtle and evades static analysis because:
1.  The code is syntactically correct and compiles without errors or warnings.
2.  Static analysis tools typically do not track the runtime state of static variables or analyze the cumulative effect of method calls across multiple requests.
3.  The `memory()` method itself is not inherently erroneous in isolation; the problem arises from its repeated execution in a critical path (`/confirm`) without a corresponding deallocation mechanism in that path.
4.  The error is path-dependent (only occurs during checkout confirmation) and state-accumulating (memory usage grows over time), making it difficult to detect during code review or with simple static checks.
5.  The issue will only manifest under load or after a significant number of checkout operations, making it hard to reproduce consistently in development or testing environments.
