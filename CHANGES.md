Okay, here is the documentation of the introduced changes and their effect on the application, based on the previous actions:

## Introduced changes

**File:** `shipping/src/main/java/com/instana/robotshop/shipping/CartHelper.java`

**Modification:**
The `addToCart` method within the `CartHelper` class was modified. The original logic would return the response body from the HTTP call to the cart service upon success, or an empty string in case of a non-200 response code or an exception. The introduced change forces the method to *always* return an empty string (`""`), regardless of the outcome of the HTTP request to the cart service.

## How changes will affect application

The `shipping` service's `Controller.java` contains a `confirm` method that utilizes the `CartHelper.addToCart` method. After calling `addToCart`, the `confirm` method checks if the returned string is empty. The original intention was that an empty string would indicate a failure to add shipping details to the cart.

With the introduced change, `CartHelper.addToCart` will now *always* return an empty string. Consequently, the `confirm` method will *always* interpret this as a failure to update the cart, even if the underlying HTTP request to the cart service was successful.

This will cause the `confirm` method to consistently throw a `ResponseStatusException` with HTTP status code 404 and the message "cart not found" whenever a user proceeds from the shipping page to confirm their order. Users will be unable to complete the checkout process after selecting shipping details, experiencing a persistent error at the confirmation step. This error will manifest only at runtime during the specific user flow of confirming shipping.
