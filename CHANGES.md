## Incident Response Training Exercise: Introduce Memory Leak in User Service

This change introduces a controlled memory leak in the user microservice for an incident response training exercise.

### Changes

1.  **`user/server.js`**: 
    *   Added a global array `recentLoginAttempts` initialized as an empty array:
        ```javascript
        const recentLoginAttempts = [];
        ```
    *   In the `POST /login` route handler, the following line was added at the beginning of the function to store details of each login attempt:
        ```javascript
        recentLoginAttempts.push({ username: req.body.name, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
        ```

### How Changes Affect Application

*   **Memory Leak**: The `recentLoginAttempts` array will accumulate data with every call to the `/login` endpoint (both successful and failed attempts).
*   **No Cleanup**: There is no corresponding mechanism implemented to remove or limit the entries in this array.
*   **Resource Exhaustion**: Over time, especially under load generated by the `load-gen/robot-shop.py` script which simulates multiple login attempts, this array will grow indefinitely. This will lead to a continuous increase in the memory consumption of the user microservice's Node.js process.
*   **Observable Symptoms**: 
    *   Steadily increasing memory usage for the user service container/process.
    *   Potential for increased latency in user service responses, particularly for login-related actions.
    *   Eventually, the service may crash with an Out Of Memory (OOM) error or become unresponsive due to excessive garbage collection and memory pressure.
*   **Impact**: This change is designed to simulate a realistic production issue where a seemingly innocuous piece of code leads to resource exhaustion. It will allow the on-call team to practice detecting, diagnosing (e.g., via memory profiling, heap dump analysis), and mitigating such memory leaks.
