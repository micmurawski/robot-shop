## Changes

- Modified the `checkSKU` method in `ratings/html/src/Service/CatalogueService.php`.
- The `curl_close($curl)` call, which is responsible for closing cURL sessions and releasing associated resources (like file descriptors), has been made conditional.
- Specifically, `curl_close($curl)` is now **skipped** if the input product `sku` (Stock Keeping Unit) begins with the letter 'E'.
- This conditional skipping of `curl_close()` has been implemented in two locations within the `checkSKU` method:
    1.  After a successful `curl_exec()` call.
    2.  Inside the `if (!$data)` block, which handles cases where `curl_exec()` fails. This makes the intentional omission less obvious as it appears in an error handling path as well.

## How Changes will affect application

This modification introduces a subtle **resource leak** that will manifest as a **resource exhaustion** problem at runtime, specifically leading to file descriptor exhaustion for the `ratings` service.

1.  **Resource Leak (File Descriptors):**
    When the `ratings` service's `checkSKU` method is called with a product SKU starting with 'E' (e.g., "Ewooid", "EPE", "EMM"), the cURL session (`$curl`) used to communicate with the `catalogue` service will be initialized and used, but it will **not be closed**.

2.  **Accumulation and Exhaustion:**
    Each unclosed cURL session holds onto system resources, most notably a file descriptor. As users interact with products whose SKUs start with 'E' (e.g., viewing product details, attempting to rate them), the `ratings` service will accumulate open, unused file descriptors.

3.  **Runtime Errors and Service Degradation:**
    Over time, the PHP process running the `ratings` service will reach the operating system's limit for the maximum number of open file descriptors allowed per process.
    Once this limit is hit, the service will start failing in various ways:
    *   It will be unable to open new network connections (e.g., to its MySQL database for storing/retrieving ratings, or to the `catalogue` service for other SKU checks).
    *   It might fail to open files for logging.
    *   Operations requiring new file descriptors will fail, leading to errors like "Too many open files" or similar system-level errors.
    *   This will result in the `ratings` service becoming unresponsive, returning errors for various API calls, or crashing entirely.

4.  **Observability Impact:**
    *   Error logs for the `ratings` service will eventually show messages related to resource limits, such as "Too many open files," connection errors to the database, or failures in cURL operations.
    *   If file descriptor usage is monitored for the process, a steady increase will be observable over time, especially when requests for SKUs starting with 'E' are made.

5.  **Evasion of Static Analysis and Linters:**
    *   The code remains syntactically valid PHP and will pass compilation and basic linting checks.
    *   Static analysis tools might not flag this as a critical issue because `curl_close()` is present in the code. The conditional logic makes it difficult for many analyzers to determine that there's a definite leak path without deep data-flow analysis or understanding the specific input values that trigger the condition.
    *   The change can appear as an unusual or perhaps misguided attempt at specific error handling or optimization, rather than a deliberate introduction of a leak, making it harder to spot during a typical code review.
