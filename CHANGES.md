## Changes

-   **`shipping/src/main/java/com/instana/robotshop/shipping/CartHelper.java`**: Modified the `addToCart` method. After a successful HTTP POST request to the cart service (status code 200), a conditional check was introduced. If the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the `id` parameter is divisible by 7, the code will intentionally skip reading the response body from the cart service.

## How Changes will affect application

The modification in `CartHelper.java` introduces a data-dependent runtime error in the shipping service. When a user proceeds to confirm shipping, the `shipping` service calls the `cart` service to add the shipping details to the user's cart. The `CartHelper.addToCart` method handles this communication.

With the introduced change, for certain user/cart IDs (specifically, those whose string representation has an ASCII sum divisible by 7), the `shipping` service will successfully send the request to the `cart` service, and the `cart` service will process it and return a 200 OK response. However, the `shipping` service will *fail to read* the response body due to the added conditional logic.

This results in the `CartHelper.addToCart` method returning an empty string instead of the updated cart data. The calling code in the `shipping` service's `Controller.java` checks if the returned cart string is empty. If it is, it throws an HTTP 404 "cart not found" error.

Therefore, users with cart IDs that meet the specific ASCII sum condition will encounter a "cart not found" error during the shipping confirmation step, even though their cart exists and the request to update it was initially successful from the `cart` service's perspective. This error will be difficult to diagnose as it depends on the specific value of the user/cart ID and will not be caught by static analysis or compilation.
