## Error 1: Resource Leak in MongoDB Connection

### File Path
user/server.js

### Error Type
Resource leak

### Description
The MongoDB client connection is not properly closed when the server shuts down, potentially leading to resource leaks. This could cause memory issues and connection pool exhaustion over time.

### Changes

1. Line 316
   - Original Code:
     ```javascript
     mongoClient.connect(mongoURL, (error, client) => {
     ```
   - Modified Code:
     ```javascript
     mongoClient.connect(mongoURL, { useUnifiedTopology: true }, (error, client) => {
     ```

2. Line 322
   - Original Code:
     ```javascript
     resolve('connected');
     ```
   - Modified Code:
     ```javascript
     resolve(client);
     ```

3. Line 329
   - Original Code:
     ```javascript
     mongoConnect().then((r) => {
     ```
   - Modified Code:
     ```javascript
     mongoConnect().then((client) => {
     ```

4. Line 331
   - Original Code:
     ```javascript
     logger.info('MongoDB connected');
     ```
   - Modified Code:
     ```javascript
     logger.info('MongoDB connected');
             process.on('SIGINT', () => {
                 client.close();
                 process.exit();
             });
     ```

The changes introduce a resource leak by not properly closing the MongoDB client connection when the server shuts down. The `client` object is now being passed around, but there's no guarantee it will be closed correctly, especially in error scenarios or during normal server shutdown processes.
