This document provides a detailed overview of the errors that were intentionally injected into the codebase. It was generated as part of a code review and testing exercise. The purpose of these injections is to simulate real-world coding mistakes and test error detection capabilities.

## Error 1: API Call Error in CityRepository

### File Path
shipping/src/main/java/com/instana/robotshop/shipping/CityRepository.java

### Line Number
15

### Error Type
API call error

### Description
The findById method is incorrectly defined. In Spring Data JPA, findById should return an Optional<City> instead of City. This can lead to potential null pointer exceptions and incorrect handling of cases where the entity is not found.

### Original Code
```java
City findById(long id);
```

### Modified Code with Error
```java
Optional<City> findById(long id);
```

This error changes the return type of the findById method, which could cause compilation errors and runtime issues if not properly handled throughout the application.
