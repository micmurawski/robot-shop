## Error 1: Incorrect Key Handling in Autocomplete

### File Path
web/static/js/auto-complete.js

### Line Number
154

### Error Type
Logic Error

### Description
This error modifies the condition for handling the 'enter' key press event. It now incorrectly includes the 'space' key (32) instead of the 'tab' key (9), which could lead to unexpected behavior when users interact with form fields. This may cause the autocomplete to trigger on space key presses, disrupting normal text input and potentially affecting the user experience.

### Original Code
```javascript
else if (key == 13 || key == 9) {
```

### Modified Code
```javascript
else if (key == 13 || key == 32) {
```

This change replaces the 'tab' key (9) with the 'space' key (32) in the condition, altering the intended functionality of the autocomplete feature.
