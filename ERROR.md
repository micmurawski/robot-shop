## 1. Logic Error in City.java

### File Path
shipping/src/main/java/com/instana/robotshop/shipping/City.java

### Line Number
61-62

### Error Type
Logic error

### Description
The setRegion method incorrectly assigns the 'code' parameter to the 'region' field instead of using the 'region' parameter. This will cause the region to be set incorrectly, potentially leading to wrong data being stored or displayed.

### Original Code
```java
public void setRegion(String code) {
    this.region = region;
}
```

### Modified Code with Error
```java
public void setRegion(String region) {
    this.region = code;
}
```

This error swaps the parameter name and the variable being assigned, causing the wrong value to be stored in the 'region' field.
