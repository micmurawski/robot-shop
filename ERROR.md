## Error 1: Incorrect JDBC URL Format

### File Path
shipping/src/main/java/com/instana/robotshop/shipping/JpaConfig.java

### Line Number
28

### Error Type
API call error

### Description
The error introduces an incorrect JDBC URL format by replacing the colon between the host and port with a comma. This will likely cause a connection failure to the database, resulting in application startup issues or runtime errors when attempting database operations.

### Original Code
```java
String jdbcUrl = String.format("jdbc:mysql://%s:%s/cities?useSSL=false&autoReconnect=true&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true", 
            host, port);
```

### Modified Code with Error
```java
String jdbcUrl = String.format("jdbc:mysql://%s,%s/cities?useSSL=false&autoReconnect=true&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true", 
            host, port);
```
